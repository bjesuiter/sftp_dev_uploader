# Upcomming Todos

1. [ ] Release a new repo for this project
2. [ ] Add github actions for building release binaries for macOS and Linux, maybe also windows
3. [ ] Add a homebrew bottle for this crate
4. [ ] Convert SftpClient to an actor which uses it's own thread. This should make handling multiple SftpClients much easier.
5. [ ] Cleanup the code, error handling and logging
