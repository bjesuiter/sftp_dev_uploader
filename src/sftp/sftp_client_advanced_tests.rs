/**
 * These so called "advanced" tests are using the public key based auth.
 * To run them, you need to have a user with a public key in the sftpgo web-ui.
 *
 * To set this up, go to the sftpgo web-ui, create a new user and add a public key.
 * Then, you can run the tests with the command `bx testsuite_advanced` (not implemented yet).
